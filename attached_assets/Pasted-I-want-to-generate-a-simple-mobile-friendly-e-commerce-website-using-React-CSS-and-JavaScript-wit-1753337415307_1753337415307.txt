I want to generate a simple, mobile-friendly e-commerce website using React, CSS, and JavaScript with the following features:

📱 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
Mobile-friendly UI with responsive design.

Use React functional components and React Router DOM for navigation.

Use local state or a simple JSON backend to store product info.

Clean and minimal styling using pure CSS (no frameworks like Tailwind).

🏠 1. HOME PAGE (/)
Show all products in a grid view.

Each product card includes:

Product image

Product name/title

Price

“View Details” button

📄 2. PRODUCT DETAILS PAGE (/product/:id)
When a user clicks a product, navigate to this page.

Display:

Product image

Name

Price

Description

“Buy Now” button

🛒 3. CHECKOUT PAGE (/checkout/:id)
When “Buy Now” is clicked, navigate to checkout page.

Display form with:

Full Name (text input)

Phone Number (text input)

Address (textarea)

“Place Order” button at the bottom

📧 4. EMAIL NOTIFICATION
On form submission:

Collect all form fields + product name

Send them to my email using EmailJS

Show alert: “Order placed successfully!”

🛠️ 5. ADMIN PANEL (/admin)
Simple login with hardcoded password admin123

After login:

See list of all products

Buttons to:

Add new product (form with name, image URL, price, description)

Edit or delete existing products

Changes should update in local state or localStorage

🔐 6. OPTIONAL BACKEND
(Optional: If backend is added, use Express + JSON DB or Firebase to store products and send email.)
